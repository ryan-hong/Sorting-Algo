# Sorting-Algo
Repository for sorting project

Through Java, I will first explore the fundamental sorting techniques, mainly focusing on MergeSort, QuickSort, InsertionSort, and HeapSort

To visualize these functions, I will create a GUI in Java using Swing

This will eventually be turned into a web app by using React
